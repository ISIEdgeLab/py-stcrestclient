This directory example Python code that uses the stchttp.py client library to
communicate with a TestCenter server over the ReST (HTTP) API.

To run the example code, you will first need to have a running TestCenter
server (Lab Server) to connect to.

Most of the commands require that a test session be started, so you need to run
the createsession.py example first, and the deletesession.py example last.
